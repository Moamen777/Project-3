    <p><b>Essam Heggy</b>is an egyptian space scientist. heggy obtained his Ph.d. in astronomy and planetary sciencein
        2002 with distinguished honors from the paris-sorbonne university in paris. his main science interests in space
        and planetary geophysics covers mars,the moon,icy satellites and near-earth objects. his research involves
        probing structural,hydrologicaland volcanic elements in terrestrial and planetary environments using different
        types of radar imaging and sounding techniques as well as measuring the electromagnetic properties of rocks in
        the radar frequency range. his research expertise span from laboratory electromagnetic characterization of
        planetary analog materials,radar sounding of aquifers in hyper-arid environments, GPR surveys in volcanic and
        ice-rich environments, FDTD numerical simulations of wave propagation and terrestrial and planetary radars data
        analysis. Heggy is a member of the science teams of several planetary exploration missions, and he is a
        contributing scientist to several proposed planetary and terrestrial radar imaging and sounding experiments.
        Heggy taught academic classes and mentored several postdocs and graduated students in UCLA, Caltech, cambridge
        university, Paris VI & Paris VII universities, institut de physique du globe, ecole normale superieure,
